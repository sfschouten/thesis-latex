        % MOTIVATION
        \glspl*{kge} (KGEs) aim to represent the entities and relations within a Knowledge Graph using continuous vector representations. This allows them to be utilized more easily for tasks such as Link Prediction, Relation Extraction, and Question Answering.
        Commonly, these embeddings focus on representing the structure of the Knowledge Graph, but incorporating semantics may increase their utility.
        % CORE OF METHOD
        We compare several methods that incorporate an abundantly available form of semantics: type-information.
        We include an existing method, TransT, as well as new methods that either construct entity-embeddings from type-embeddings, or model type-distributions over entity-embeddings.
        We perform extensive hyper-parameter searches in order to compare the performance of these methods when applied to the Link Prediction task.
        % MAIN RESULT
        % surprisingly high performance 
        We observe up to 261\% increase of MRR against a TransE baseline for a class of methods that learned to represent each entity by one of its types, using that type's embedding as the entity's embedding. Other methods result in a modest increase in performance relative to their non-semantic baseline.
        % TAKEAWAY
        While it remains challenging to incorporate type-information such that it may benefit more than just Link Prediction, the high performance we observe shows there is great potential in its utilization.
