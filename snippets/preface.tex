\chapter{Preface}

The first time I became interested in Knowledge Graphs was during my bachelor's thesis project.
During the project we developed a prototype for the automated summarization of medical consultation dialogues. The architecture we were tasked with implementing envisioned a knowledge graph (with prespecified ontology) at the center. Facts from the dialogue would first be extracted and stored in the knowledge graph, and then the relevant part of the knowledge graph would be used to generate a summary.

Under some naive assumptions we managed to implement this well enough for a proof of concept. But since then I've been fascinated by the possibility of taking advantage of recent advances in Deep Learning to perform this kind of knowledge extraction from natural language.
What motivated me to choose the topic of this thesis was that the inclusion of semantics (both those represented in an ontology, and those from natural languages) in Knowledge Graph Embeddings seems vital for them to be used in this type of knowledge extraction.
